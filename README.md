# shopping-website
 Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I've built a cool shopping website using JQuery, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It might not be Amazon, but it's got some neat features I think you'll love.

**What's Under The Hood?**
This isn't your average shopping site. I've spiced things up by incorporating Axios to fetch product data from the fake store API. This means you'll always have fresh, up-to-date product info at your fingertips.

**Currency Conversion? Got It Covered!**
No need to pull out your calculator app or Google the conversion rate. You can view product prices in CAD, USD, or Euros. All with a click of a button.

**Supercharged Checkout Process**
Ever got frustrated by a clunky checkout process? Yeah, me too. That's why I've added form validation for all steps of the checkout process. Plus, you can choose to have your billing details automatically match your shipping info. Of course, you're free to enter a different shipping address if that's what you prefer.

**Tax Calculation - No Surprises**
Oh, and about taxes - they're automatically calculated based on the provincial tax of the shipping address. No hidden costs, no unexpected charges. Just simple, transparent shopping.

So go ahead, check it out and let me know what you think. I'm always up for improving things and your feedback is much appreciated. Enjoy shopping!
